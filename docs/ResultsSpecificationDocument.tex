\large APE Browser Tool - Results Specification Document

\section{Introduction}
This document outlines the return XML document structure to hold the results from the Browser Evaluation Tool, specifically for the APE Interface.

\section{Root}
The root of the document is \texttt{BrowserEvaluationResult}. This takes no attributes but contains all children.

\section{Track}
The first child element is the \texttt{Track} element. This contains the results for a specific track. This requires the attribute \texttt{trackId} to be set to the numerical track Id.

\subsection{Value}
One of these elements per track, containing the value between 0 and 100 relating the user rating of the track. This is a mandatory element.
% float or int? (I, Brecht, am sort of indifferent here, it used to be down to .01 or something before, so maybe that or .1)

\subsection{Comment}
One of these elements per track, containing any commenting data from the interface text boxes.

\section{Session Data}
This will contain any captured session data. Currently not implemented but here for future referencing.
% I used to have a 'global' comment for each 'session' as well

\section{Globals}
Contains any comment boxes which were specified in the APE project specification with the comment ID, comment text and the comment results.
